Marvel Heroes app written in Objective-C that makes use of CollectionViews, Asynchronous Networking, Gestures and Transitions

For this project you will create an app, written entirely in Objective-C, that makes use of CollectionViews, Asynchronous Networking, Gestures and Transitions. You can certainly incorporate other features and tools, but be sure you also make use of those four listed. In addition, the CollectionViewCells must be interactive in a meaningful way and networking should make use of proper error handling.

You are free to pick a topic of your choice, but must make sure to showcase the topics listed above. Below are a few examples of potential apps to build, or places to start, though the sky’s the limit. We suggest picking a content area that excites you and will make for a good portfolio piece.

- A recipe app that retrieves recipes from an API and displays each recipe on a card in the collection view. Tapping on a card would transition to a larger view displaying the full recipe.

- An API-driven comics app utilizing Marvel’s API.

- A baseball card app where the cells in the collection view each represent a player, whose image and stats are pulled from an API. Tapping on an individual card would toggle between the statistics and the photo, like the front and back of a cardboard baseball card.

- An API-driven stock market app where cells represent particular stocks. Gestures could be used to display alternate views or data about the stocks.

- A personal restaurant review app that retrieves data about local restaurants from an API and allows users to add photos, comments, share with friends, etc...

For all of the above, you might want to employ third party libraries to add more advanced features. Just be sure that your primary implementation of: CollectionViews, Asynchronous Networking, Gestures and Transitions are your own work.
